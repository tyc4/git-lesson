# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of using git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp.

To make a commit (or "version" or "checkpoint") of your files, follow this procedure:
    1. Make changes
    2. Tell git to create a commit by adding files to the staging area using "git add filename"
    3. create checkpoint ("commit') using 'git commit -m "msg about what you did"'
